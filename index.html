  <h2>Does Sleep Affect Academic Performance in Teens?</h2>
  
  <p>     Does Sleep Affect academic performance in teens? Many scientists have researched this topic, and various answers have been proposed. I have asked 29 teenage students in the state of Morgantown, West Virginia a few questions, such as how many hours of sleep they get on school nights. What grade are they in? How many hours do they study? Are you tired during School? Do you use your phone or TV before bed? Lastly, I asked if they think sleep affects their academic performance. Now, before we get deep into the topic, let’s define what I mean by academic performance. By academic performance, I mean, when coming to school, are you energetic, are you able to concentrate on what the teacher is teaching, are you able to do the assignments given to you by your teacher? Now you might be thinking those factors might come from a completely different source, and my answer to you is that’s precisely what we are trying to figure out. 

Knowing how many hours teenagers sleep on school nights is critical to understanding their academic performance. Sleep is an essential thing that many people need, and not having enough of it can lead to different things, like Lack of concentration, Anxiety, Depression, and chronic conditions. As you can see on the chart, the teenagers' maximum sleep amount was 10 hours, which is quite good, especially for a school night. Many scientists agree that sleeping 8-10 hours is the recommended sleep range. Out of the nine people who claimed to sleep 8-10 hours during school nights, only two said they aren’t tired during school. Which makes me wonder: Should the recommended amount of sleep be more than 8-10 hours, or does the actual amount of sleep you get even matter? 

Knowing the number of hours you study is crucial because the number of hours you study can show how you academically perform in school. On the chart, the most amount of hours a teen studied  in a week was 10 hours. Educators recommend studying for about 2 hours per night, which in a school week should be about 10 hours. So now you're probably wondering if you study 10 hours and you don’t get enough sleep, your academic performance should still be excellent. Which still makes me question does sleep really matter?

Now, by looking at each individual's grade, they are all in grades 9+, which is considered a freshman in high school in the state of West Virginia. Now the teenager's grade is very important because going into different grades, you start experiencing different feelings about school For example, a 10th grader can get a whole 10 hours of sleep and study 10 hours a week and still feel tired during school. The highest grade was grade 12, indicating extensive experience in school. He reported feeling tired at school but doesn't believe sleep affects academic performance. On the char,t you can see that the people in 11 grade and lower picked mostly yes, meaning these teenagers think that sleep affects there academic performance. 

I asked the high schoolers, 'Do you use your phone or your TV before bed?' and most of them said their phone. Now, as you know, using your phone before bed can lead to things like being unable to go to sleep, even if you do fall asleep, you could be in a very deep sleep, and it could also lead to some form of anxiety.

Many people believe that school affects your academic performance, but your performance ultimately depends on your motivation. That’s why I believe it's 50/50; many teens just use sleep as an excuse for not performing well in school. Sleep is crucial for staying active and giving your full attention to your teacher. But, if you know how to study after or before school, once your teacher gives you a worksheet to feel out, you’ll already know what to do.
